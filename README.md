### Collaborative Filtering using Gaussian Mixtures, BIC and Improved Jaccard Similarity

#### Abstract 

Collaborative filtering is a challenging and emerging field of research with a wide range
of applications. Main applications especially being in recommender systems due to its
simplicity and efficiency. There are several algorithms and techniques proposed in litera-
ture for the same. In this project we implement a collaborative filtering algorithm which
makes use of Gaussian Mixture models to cluster users and reduce sparsity in the original
data matrix and build a new interaction matrix, followed by item to item Jaccard simi-
larity based scoring to make predictions. We also evaluate our method on three popular
public data bases (namely Movie Lens 100K, 1M and Netflix) and analyse the obtained
results.

- Datasets used: Movie Lens 100K, Movie Lens 1M and Netflix 1200
